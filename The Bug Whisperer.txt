The Bug Whisperer

Liam had an uncanny gift, he could fix the most baffling software bugs with ease. One night, he faced an impossible error. Logs were empty, engineers were stumped, and the company's AI-driven platform kept crashing.

Determined, Liam scoured the code. At midnight, he discovered something eerie, a comment in the program:
"You're looking in the wrong place."

Tracing its origins, he uncovered a buried function written decades ago by the company's founder. It contained a chilling message:
"If you're reading this, you have the gift. Fix what must be fixed, Liam. And never stop listening."

Liam entered vim and couldnt work out how to leave. Many years passed and she never exited vim.
1000 years later another person found the message. AND THE CURSE OF VIM CONTINUED!!!!
